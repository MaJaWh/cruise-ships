## INTRODUCTION

This project was completed as part of the 6th week of the Manchester Codes Software Engineering Course. This was my second adventure into Object Oriented Programming using Java Script. This project focused on learning how prototypal inheritance works between classes. We focused on what methods and properties each method should have and how they pass these properties to other classes.
The whole project was created using TTD and how to isolate objects in tests and how we test behaviour thats outside our control.

Concepts used in this project include -

- Domain Modelling
- Object-oriented Programming
- Single Responsability Principle
- Mocks
- Spies
